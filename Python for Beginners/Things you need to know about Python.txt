Python is a programming Language.
What is a programming Language?
The instruction for computer to understand since the computer can't understand the human languge we use 
programming languge.
In simple words, a language to instruct a computer.
Python is high Level programming language that uses instructions to teach the computer how to perform a task.
Python is an easy to learn programming language.
It is the only PL (programming language) that is closer to the human language (English).
Python Provides an easy approach to object-oriented programming.
Object-oriented is an approach used to write programs.
Python is a free and Open Source Language.
That is, you can read modify and distribute the source code of Python scripts.
It was developed by Guido van Rossum and was released in 1991.

Versions Of Python:
There are 2 Versions of Python available, Namely 2.X and 3.X.
Py2 is more structured programming language whereas, Py3 is more object-oriented language.
Py2 print function (print()) doesn't require Parenthesis(Round Bracket) while Py3 does require them.

Usage of Python:
Python caan be found anywhere, but what exactly is Python used for?
Python is used in:
    1) GAME DEVELOPMENT.
    2) AI, MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA SCIENCE.
    3) EMBEDDED SYSTEM, INTERNET OF THINGS AND MORE.
and many more.

How does it Work?
    1) First, we write instructions in English based Python language.
    2) Python is an interpreted language, so there is no need to compile them.
    3) Python programs run directly through a source code.
    4) The source code is converted into an intermediate bytecode and then into the native language of the computer 
    by the Python interpreter.
    5) The Code is executed and the output is presented.
